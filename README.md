At MagiQSim we specialize in classical simulation algorithms for universal quantum computation. In the field of theoretical quantum computing, understanding the reasons behind quantum advantage remains an open problem. This challenge can be rigorously investigated by developing classical simulation algorithms and analyzing their efficiency.

{Stabilizer theory is key to unlocking many quantum features. In this formalism t}here are two primary classes of simulation algorithms: (1) stabilizer tableau simulation, such as Gottesmann-Knill simulation \cite{aaronson2004improved}, which efficiently simulates stabilizer circuits, and (2) sampling algorithms, such as discrete Wigner functions, mainly applicable to qubits of odd local dimensions \cite{veitch2012negative}. Recently, a new sampling algorithm, known as the $\Lambda$ simulation \cite{zurel2020hidden}, was developed using operator-theoretic polytopes. The distinguishing feature of this simulation algorithm is that quantum states and operations are represented positively, i.e., by a probability distribution. In contrast, previous sampling algorithms generated quasi-probability distributions that could assume negative values. The presence of negativity in quasi-probability representations is identified as a source of quantum speedup. However, in the $\Lambda$ simulation, this negativity is absent, and the source of quantum speedup is currently under theoretical investigation.

Our core technology leverages classical simulation algorithms, such as $\Lambda$ simulation (MagiQ Simulator), to tackle computationally hard problems. Our methods utilize cutting-edge theoretical techniques from polytope theory and algebraic topology. By employing these advanced and unique tools, we enhance existing simulation algorithms and explore new ones.
